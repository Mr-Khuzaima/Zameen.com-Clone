Project Name: DoctorLand.com - Real Estate Website (Zameen.com Clone)

Project Overview:
------------------
DoctorLand.com is a complete front-end replica of Pakistan's leading real estate website, Zameen.com. 
This project aims to recreate the core design, layout, and user experience of Zameen.com using modern 
web technologies. The project consists of 32 fully designed web pages covering all the major features 
and sections found on the original platform.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to replicate a professional real estate portal
 using front-end development tools and clean code practices.

Technologies Used:
-------------------
- HTML5 (Structure)
- CSS3 (Styling)
- Tailwind CSS (Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design)
- Bootstrap (Pre-built responsive components and grid system)
- JavaScript (Basic interactivity and UI behavior)

Project Structure:
-------------------
The project follows a clean and organized folder structure:

1. /HTML        → Contains all the 32 HTML pages (Home, Listings, About, Contact, Blog, etc.)
2. /CSS         → Contains all external CSS files used for styling (Most pages use external styling)
3. /JS          → Contains JavaScript files for page behavior, menus, sliders, and interactivity
4. /Images      → All image assets used across the website (banners, logos, property images, icons, etc.)

Note: Around 4 to 5 pages use internal CSS (written inside the `<style>` tag in the HTML files). The rest 
of the styling is managed through external CSS files.
